# Portfolio
* The portfolio passes the html checker without any errors or warnings.

* The css has no errors, it has warnings regarding colours not set in different rules, I don't fix the warnings otherwise it breaks the principle of cascading style sheets.

* Google Mobile-friendly is an application that informs if the website is adapted for viewing on mobile devices. As it does not show any errors, it indicates that my website is adaptable.

The following two tools check the accessibility of the website:
1. WAVE

2. aChecker

Both tools do not report any errors so my website is accessible.

With respect to code:
1. In the CSS I have prioritised the use of relative measures.
2. To make the personal image responsive, I have made it as follows.

3. I have used the embed map provided by google maps.
4. I have added transition in this part of the application, where if you put the mouse over the photos they become bigger and you can see them better, the main idea is to make it work as a photo gallery.
